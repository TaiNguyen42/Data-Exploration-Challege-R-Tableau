# Global Drug Seizures Data Exploration Project

Welcome to my repository, where I dive deep into the complex world of global drug seizures from 1980 to 2020. My team has embarked on a journey to explore and analyze the intricacies of drug seizures worldwide, leveraging data to uncover insights and present our findings through an engaging narrative, comprehensive data dashboards, and detailed analysis.

## Project Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of global drug seizure data over four decades, focusing on trends, quantities, and geographical distribution of drug seizures. By examining the patterns of drug confiscations worldwide, our aim is to illuminate the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts, the evolving landscape of the drug trade, and provide actionable insights through our explorations.

## Key Findings
- General Increase: We observed a general rise in the quantity of drug seizures, punctuated by notable spikes due to significant law enforcement actions.
- Regional Hotspots: Europe and the Americas have emerged as significant centers for drug seizures, influenced by their legal systems, market demands, and strategic locations.
- Drug Trends: Cannabis and opioids have consistently been the most seized drugs. However, there is a notable rising trend in the seizures of Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).

## Methodology
Utilizing a comprehensive dataset detailing drug types, seized quantities, countries, and years, we employed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights. This project not only looks into the quantitative aspect of drug seizures but also explores the underlying stories that the data tells us about the global efforts against the drug trade.

## Data Exploration Process
- Data Selection: We selected a rich dataset that allows for a multifaceted analysis of the drug seizure landscape.
- Exploratory Analysis: Employing EDA techniques, we delved into the dataset to uncover intriguing patterns and stories.
- Dashboard Development: An interactive data dashboard was created to visually narrate our findings, ensuring clarity and engagement.
- Memo Crafting: A detailed memo accompanies our dashboard, providing a narrative that explains our findings, methodology, and the implications of our analysis.

## Audience
Our project is designed for a non-technical audience, with the goal of making complex data both accessible and engaging. Through meticulous explanation and visualization, we aim to translate data insights into compelling narratives that can inform, educate, and inspire action.

## Technologies Used
- R: Utilized for data cleaning, analysis, and exploratory data visualization.
- Tableau: Employed to develop interactive data dashboards that visually narrate our data stories.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we demonstrate the power of data in unraveling the complexities of global drug seizures and highlight the potential of data storytelling. We invite you to explore our dashboard, read our memo, and engage with the insights we've uncovered, as we shine a light on the global battle against drug trafficking.
