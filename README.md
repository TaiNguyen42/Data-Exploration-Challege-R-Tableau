# Global Drug Seizures & Data Exploration Challenge Repository

Welcome to our repository where we tackle two complex and engaging projects: "Changes in Global Drug Seizures from 1980 to 2020" and the "Data Exploration Challenge." Our team, composed of data enthusiasts and analytical minds, delved into these topics to uncover insights and present our findings through data dashboards, comprehensive analysis, and engaging narratives.

## Changes in Global Drug Seizures (1980 - 2020)
### Overview
This project analyzes global drug seizure data over four decades, focusing on trends, quantities, and geographical distribution of drug seizures. By examining the patterns of drug confiscations worldwide, we aim to shed light on the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts and the changing landscape of the drug trade.

## Key Findings
- A general increase in the quantity of drug seizures, with notable spikes attributed to significant law enforcement actions.
- Europe and the Americas emerge as significant centers for drug seizures, influenced by legal systems, market demands, and production locations.
- Cannabis and opioids remain the most seized drugs, with a rising trend in Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) seizures.
